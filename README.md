# Product Authentication System

A decentralized product authentication system built on Polygon blockchain that enables brands and manufacturers to create, verify, and track authentic products using NFTs.

## üåê Why Polygon?

This system is specifically built for the Polygon network, offering several advantages:
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet
- **High Speed**: Fast block confirmation times (~2 seconds)
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Full EVM compatibility while maintaining scalability
- **Enterprise Ready**: Suitable for high-volume product authentication
- **Green Blockchain**: Energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus
- **Network Stability**: High uptime and robust infrastructure

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract Development**
  - Solidity ^0.8.26
  - Hardhat for compilation and testing
  - OpenZeppelin contracts

- **Deployment & Interaction**
  - Ethers.js v6
  - TypeScript

- **Frontend**
  - Next.js
  - React
  - TailwindCSS
  - Web3 wallet integration

- **Storage**
  - IPFS via Web3.Storage (Storacha)
  - Decentralized metadata storage
  - Product images and details
  - Immutable content addressing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend Notice
The current frontend implementation interfaces with the deprecated `ProductValidation.sol` contract. A new frontend implementation that works with the Registry system is under development.

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

The system consists of four main smart contracts that work together to provide a complete product authentication solution:

### Registry Contracts

1. **BrandRegistry.sol**
   - Manages brand registration and ownership
   - Stores brand metadata on IPFS
   - Enables brand ownership transfer
   - Provides brand verification endpoints

2. **ManufacturerRegistry.sol**
   - Handles manufacturer registration
   - Stores manufacturer credentials and metadata
   - Manages manufacturer verification
   - Supports ownership transfer

3. **ProductRegistry.sol**
   - Creates and tracks authentic products
   - Links products to their respective brands
   - Maintains product verification records
   - Stores product metadata and specifications

4. **ProductToken.sol**
   - Implements ERC1155 token standard
   - Manages batch production requests
   - Handles token minting and distribution
   - Provides complete verification chain

## üîÑ System Flow

The system implements a secure flow for product authentication:

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-connection:mainnet": "tsx scripts/test-connection.ts",
    "test-connection:amoy": "tsx scripts/test-connection.ts --testnet",
    "deploy:mainnet": "tsx scripts/ethers-deploy.ts",
    "deploy:amoy": "tsx scripts/ethers-deploy.ts --testnet",
    "compile": "npx hardhat compile"
  }
}
```

### Command Descriptions

- **Compilation**
  - `npm run compile`: Compiles all Solidity contracts using Hardhat
    - Generates contract artifacts in `artifacts/` directory
    - Creates TypeScript typings for contracts

- **Connection Testing**
  - `npm run test-connection:mainnet`: Tests connection to Ethereum mainnet
    - Verifies RPC endpoint connectivity
    - Checks wallet configuration
    - Validates network status
  
  - `npm run test-connection:amoy`: Tests connection to Amoy testnet
    - Same checks as mainnet but for testnet
    - Ensures testnet RPC is accessible
    - Verifies testnet wallet setup

- **Deployment**
  - `npm run deploy:mainnet`: Deploys contracts to Ethereum mainnet
    - Uses ethers v6 for deployment
    - Requires proper environment variables
    - Handles contract constructor arguments
    
  - `npm run deploy:amoy`: Deploys contracts to Amoy testnet
    - Same functionality as mainnet deployment
    - Uses testnet configuration
    - Lower gas costs for testing

### Deployment Process

1. **Test Network Connection**
```bash
# For mainnet
npm run test-connection:mainnet

# For Amoy testnet
npm run test-connection:amoy
```

2. **Compile Contracts**
```bash
npm run compile
```

3. **Deploy Contracts**
```bash
# For mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet BrandRegistry
npm run deploy:mainnet ManufacturerRegistry
npm run deploy:mainnet <brandRegistryAddress> ProductRegistry 
npm run deploy:mainnet <productRegistryAddress> <brandRegistryAddress> <manufacturerRegistryAddress> ProductToken 

# For Amoy testnet
npm run deploy:amoy BrandRegistry
npm run deploy:amoy ManufacturerRegistry
npm run deploy:amoy <brandRegistryAddress> ProductRegistry 
npm run deploy:amoy <productRegistryAddress> <brandRegistryAddress> <manufacturerRegistryAddress> ProductToken

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
```env
FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS=    # Fee collector address
POLYGON_MAINNET_WS_URL=    # Mainnet WS RPC URL
POLYGON_TESTNET_URL=    # Amoy testnet RPC URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN=    # Web3 Storage API token (Storacha)
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=    # 'mainnet' or 'testnet'
PRIVATE_KEY=           # Deployment wallet private key
```

## üîë Key Features

- **Decentralized Authentication**: Leverages blockchain for immutable product records

## üí∞ Fee Structure

The system implements a modest fee structure to maintain sustainability and prevent spam while keeping costs reasonable for legitimate users.

### Registry Operations

All registry contracts (Brand, Manufacturer, Product) include the following fees:

- **Registration Fee**: 0.001 ETH (~$2-3)
  - Charged when registering new brands, manufacturers, or products
  - One-time fee per entity

- **Transfer Fee**: 0.0005 ETH (~$1-1.5)
  - Charged when transferring ownership of any entity
  - Applied to brand transfers, manufacturer transfers, and product transfers

### Product Token Operations

The ProductToken contract includes additional fees for batch and minting operations:

- **Batch Request Fee**: 0.001 ETH (~$2-3)
  - Charged when manufacturers request a new batch of products
  - One-time fee per batch, regardless of quantity

- **Minting Fee**: 0.0002 ETH (~$0.50)
  - Charged when minting individual product tokens
  - Per-token fee that scales with quantity

### Fee Management

- Fees are collected by a designated fee collector address
- Fee amounts can be adjusted by the fee collector to respond to market conditions
- All fee collections and updates are tracked through blockchain events
- Fees are denominated in ETH but paid in MATIC on the Polygon network

### Benefits

- Low fees encourage legitimate usage while deterring spam
- Per-operation pricing ensures fair cost distribution
- Scaling fees (like minting) align costs with system usage
- Transparent fee structure with on-chain verification
- Fee collector role enables future DAO governance
